        description : "I worked with three colleagues using the SCRUM methodology to create an e-commerce website for sports-related products. The website includes the following features: 1. Displaying and paginating products that can be searched, filtered, and sorted. 2. A product detail page where users can select the quantity and add items to their cart. 3. To add items to the cart, users must register or log in. 4. Once items are added to the cart, users can continue shopping or proceed to checkout and pay using a credit/debit card, which will be processed by Stripe. 5. Users have full control over their account and can access their dashboard, where they can manage their information and purchased products. 6. The application has an admin panel where you can find real-time information about platform purchases, sales figures and comparisons for up to 6 months, manage registered users on the platform, suspend or delete them, manage products (add new, edit, suspend, or delete), manage categories (create and list new ones), and view orders (which are listed only). Overall, it was a very enriching experience in terms of knowledge, experience, and skills. Project link: https://fastball-production-pf.up.railway.app/",
